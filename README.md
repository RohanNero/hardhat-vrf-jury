# VRF Jury

- ### The purpose of this repo is to create a framework for a potentially **improved Jury selection process.**

- ### The current process claims to use a pool of registered voters/drivers licenses to randomly select jurors.

- ### However details about the _"random"_ selection is unclear or not easily available to the public.

#### _see images/randomness for some screenshots from various places_

- ### Instead of relying on individuals who could be acting under a bias or alterier motive to randomly select jurors,

- ### using VRF is a way to negate that trust weak point.

_(instead of VRF: even a variety of block.timestamps/hashes/numbers from a couple chains could be sufficient without needing offchain oracle magic, nonetheless I shall still create it using VRF)_
