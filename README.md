# VRF Jury

### The purpose of this repo is to create a framework for a potentially **improved Jury selection process.**

- The current process claims to use a pool of registered voters/drivers licenses to randomly select jurors;

  details about the _"random"_ selection is unclear or not easily available to the public.

  - _see `images/randomness` for some screenshots from various places_

- Instead of relying on individuals who could be acting under a bias or alterier motive to randomly select jurors,

  using VRF is a way to negate that trust weak point.

  - _(instead of VRF: even a variety of block.timestamps/hashes/numbers from a couple chains could be sufficient without needing offchain oracle magic, nonetheless I shall still create it using VRF)_
